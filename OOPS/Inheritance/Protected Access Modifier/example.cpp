// Protected Access Modifiers in C++
// Protected access modifiers are similar to the private access modifiers
// but protected access modifiers can be accessed in the derived 
// class whereas private access modifiers cannot be accessed in the derived class. 
// A table is shown below which shows the behavior of access modifiers 
// when they are derived“public”, “private”, and “protected”.







//  	                        Public Derivation      	   Private Derivation         Protected Derivation
// Private members           	Not Inherited              	Not Inherited             Not Inherited              
// Protected members           Protected                   Private                    Protected                    
// Public members           	Public	                    Private                    Protected        







// As shown in the table,--
// If the class is inherited in public mode then its private members cannot be inherited in child class.
// If the class is inherited in public mode then its protected members are protected and can be accessed in child class.
// If the class is inherited in public mode then its public members are public and can be accessed inside child class and outside the class.
// If the class is inherited in private mode then its private members cannot be inherited in child class.
// If the class is inherited in private mode then its protected members are private and cannot be accessed in child class.
// If the class is inherited in private mode then its public members are private and cannot be accessed in child class.
// If the class is inherited in protected mode then its private members cannot be inherited in child class.
// If the class is inherited in protected mode then its protected members are protected and can be accessed in child class.
// If the class is inherited in protected mode then its public members are protected and can be accessed in child class.
